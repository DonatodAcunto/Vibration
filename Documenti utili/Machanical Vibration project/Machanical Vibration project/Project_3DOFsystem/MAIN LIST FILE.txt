PARAMETERS IDENTIFICATION****************************************************************************

file data steps.mat: use the step response to verify the ratio between the stiffnesses of the
springs. Compute a new estimation for the voltage-to-force coeficient.

	Param_id_steps.m

file data impulses.mat: use the impulse response to identify the parameters. Choose
between response to impulsive force or response to initial conditions: in the first case,
due to the approximation of the force estimation, you can consider the voltage-to-force
coeficient as one of the parameters to be estimated.

	Param_id_opt_impulsive.m

repeat the estimation of your parameters by assuming proportional damping. How many
parameters have to be identified?

	Param_id_opt_Proportional_impulsive.m

in order to improve the estimation of the parameters, the springs can be detached and the
masses can be blocked at their equilibrium position: describe a possible strategy for the
estimation of the parameters by studying the behaviour of three different 1 DOF systems.

MODAL ANALYSIS***************************************************************************************

use Rayleigh quotient and Matrix Iteration Method to estimate the modes of the un-
damped system. Compare the results with the ones of the eigenvalue problem.

	Modal_Analisys_free_damping.m

use Laplace transform to plot the transfer functions between the applied force and the
positions of the degrees of freedom.

	Bode_plots.m

repeat the previous operations for the proportional damping case (and compare the re-
sults with the ones of the generic damping case). Use the modes of the proportional
damping case to write an analytical expression for the configurations thanks to modal
decomposition.

SINE SWEEP***********************************************************************************************

Use data sine sweep slow.mat and data sine sweep fast.mat to compute the transfer functions
numerically (data sine sweep fast.mat has a different sampling period).
. compare the results of the two data sets.
. compare the sine-sweep response with the results of the modal analysis (generic damping case).
